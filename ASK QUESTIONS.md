# Ask questions for Phd project
1. molecuor dynamics simulation may hlepful to understand the breakage of flocculation
2. Does the different frequencies of wave affect the CLAY FLOCCULATION
3. COULD THE LARGE SCLAE MODEL CAN SIMULATE THE interaction of nutrients and phytoplankton
4. different size of compounds interation in terms of size change
5. do the small simulation to invetigate the the absorbtion stabilztion time scale and absorbtion rate and time-SPACE evolution
